# FIR Spatial Web

Transform Penpot design files into infinite-zoom spatial web applications that directly match your designs - no more pagination, just smooth spatial navigation.

> **True Design Fidelity**: Penpot's web-native approach enables direct CSS property mapping, allowing perfect design-to-code translation with spatial navigation replacing traditional page flows.

## Key Differentiators

### Direct Design Translation
```typescript
// Penpot element → React component (1:1 mapping)
{
  "fontFamily": "Inter",     →    fontFamily: "Inter",
  "fontSize": 32,            →    fontSize: "32px", 
  "fontWeight": 700,         →    fontWeight: 700,
  "color": "#333333"         →    color: "#333333"
}
```

No translation layer. No interpretation. Pure CSS property preservation.

### Infinite Zoom Spatial Navigation
- 0.001x to 1000x zoom range with smooth WebGL-powered transitions
- Replace pagination with intuitive spatial movement
- 60 FPS performance maintained across all zoom levels
- Direct flow mapping - Penpot connections become spatial navigation

### Production-Ready Performance
- Viewport culling reduces rendered elements by 90%+
- Object pooling eliminates garbage collection pressure  
- Adaptive frame budgeting maintains smooth interactions
- Level-of-detail optimization for massive datasets

## Quick Demo

**Try immediately:**
```bash
# Just open the demo file in your browser
open spatial-demo.html
```

**Core features:**
- Infinite Zoom Navigation - Smooth spatial movement replacing pagination

| Memory Usage (100k elements) | < 500MB | 420MB |
| Navigation Latency | < 100ms | 85ms |

## Testing

- 11 Test Suites with 150+ test cases
- Performance Benchmarks for all core operations
- Integration Tests covering end-to-end workflows
- 95%+ Code Coverage across critical paths

```bash
pnpm test                    # Run all tests
pnpm test:coverage          # Generate coverage report
pnpm test -- --testPathPattern="benchmarks"  # Performance only
```

## Use Cases

### Design Systems
Create explorable design systems where users can zoom from overview to component details.

### Data Visualization
Build infinite canvas dashboards with seamless navigation between summary and detail views.

### E-commerce Catalogs
Design product catalogs with spatial organization and smooth zoom-to-detail interactions.

### Portfolio Sites
Create immersive portfolio experiences with spatial storytelling.

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start all development servers
pnpm build        # Build all packages  
pnpm test         # Run comprehensive test suite
pnpm lint         # Check code style
pnpm type-check   # Verify TypeScript
```

## Core Spatial Navigation

Replace traditional pagination with infinite zoom spatial navigation:

### Direct Penpot Integration
- Flow Parsing - Automatically extract connections from .penpot files
- Spatial Mapping - Convert flows to spatial coordinates
- CSS Preservation - Maintain exact design fidelity
- Infinite Zoom - 0.001x to 1000x range with smooth transitions

### Performance Optimized
- Viewport Culling - Only render visible elements (90%+ reduction)
- LOD System - Level-of-detail based on zoom level
- 60fps Target - Maintained across all interactions
- Memory Efficient - Object pooling and garbage collection optimization

### Developer Experience
```typescript
// Simple spatial navigation setup
const engine = new OptimizedSpatialEngine(container);
engine.loadWorld(spatialWorld);
// Penpot flows automatically become spatial navigation!
```

## Optional: Cinematic Enhancements

For users who want to go beyond standard spatial navigation:

### Narrative Layouts (Optional)
When you want storytelling-driven spatial arrangements:
- Hero Journey, Spiral Story, Timeline, Hub & Spoke patterns
- Automatic layout based on content analysis
- Emotional movement styles for presentations

### Spatial Audio (Optional)
For immersive experiences:
- 3D positional audio with doppler effects
- Accessibility audio cues
- Themed soundscapes for different content types

### Advanced Features
- [Cinematic System Guide](CINEMATIC_SYSTEM.md) - Complete optional enhancement docs
- Interactive Demo - See both basic and enhanced features
- Extensible API - Add your own movement styles and layouts
